                            <cite>After feeling uneasy searching and talking to a few other makeup artists, I found Angela’s website. I was immediately impressed and knew I wanted Angela to do my makeup for my wedding. I contacted her and she immediately responded and I was thrilled she still had my wedding day open. I just had a feeling she would be the perfect makeup artist for my wedding day. We set up the trial and I was so beyond impressed on the way it turned out! I signed the contract that day. Angela came to my house and did my mom, maid of honor, a bridesmaid, and myself. She even came earlier to ensure we were all done on time. Even my maid of honor (who is very picky) loved her. She was very personable, professional, and just fun to be around. She is definitely going to be someone I recommend to everyone I know getting married. Ever bride is so worried about how everything is going to turn out, but with Angela you won’t have to worry about your makeup because she will make you look absolutely gorgeous and stunning! Thank you again Angela for everything!</cite>

                            <cite>I contacted Angela Makeup Chicago about 2 weeks prior to my wedding due to my makeup and hair person falling through at the last minute. I was extremely nervous because I never had anyone due my makeup and only 1 person I really let do my hair. I have Asian hair and just got it cut and decided to try hair extensions at the last minute. I emailed the company and was assured right away that Courtney could handle all my trial and wedding needs :) I drove 4 hours to Chicago for a hair trial with my extensions and hairpiece and she did an amazing job in a short amount of time. She put me at ease right away. The day of my wedding, in the midst of all of my chaos, She was on time..she followed my ques and did an absolutely beautiful job on both my hair and makeup! I got the airbrush makeup and 18 inch extensions pinned to a side bun (vintage look) and eyelash extensions. She did my makeup and hair at 230pm and it was still flawless by 4am! It held up through all the heat of the outdoor wedding and the indoor reception where I danced all night! We were all sweaty but I still looked amazing throughout the night even with 2 flash photographers following me around, I didn't even Have to touch up! Thanks again Courtney and Angela for recommending her! She was Truly irreplaceable! </cite>

                            <cite>I used Angela Makeup Chicago for my hair and makeup along with my Maid of Honor's hair. Angela was very prompt at responding to emails. Ashley was my stylist and did an amazing job. I got many compliments on how well my makeup looked along with how good it looked even after my reception was over. My hair and makeup turned out even better than what I had envisioned. I highly recommend Angela Makeup and Ashley too!! </cite>

                            <cite>From the first time I contacted Angela she was nothing short of amazing. She responded to my first e-mail within minutes and we went back and forth corresponding with questions till I finally booked. Her prices were fair for a vendor willing to travel to your location to do hair/makeup. I booked pretty far in advance since I got married on one of the most popular wedding dates of 2011. My mom and I went to Angela's location for the trial and she was fantastic. I found out that Courtnie was going to be doing my hair and makeup for the wedding, so she was there to do the trial. I had brought pictures for the hair portion, but makeup I left completely up to Courtnie. I was thrilled with how it all came out! The day of was even better! Courtnie showed up on time ready to do my hair/makeup, 3 of my bridesmaids hair, and my mom's makeup. She stayed on schedule and everyone was done on time. (Even a little early!) All my girls absolutely loved their hair, my mom was thrilled with their makeup, and I was astonished with how good she made me look! Overall, it was more than we could have asked for. Both Angela and Courtnie are so nice and professional! I would definitely recommend Angela Makeup Chicago to anyone wanting hair/makeup done for their special day! </cite>

                     Much love from a grateful gal,

                     <li><cite>I found Angela by a search on google for my wedding, because i wanted a make up artist. I loved her website and I emailed her to get more details. Not only did she email me back RIGHT AWAY, she had a warm feeling about her, just from the email. She was professional, personable and we set a trial run day. She did an amazing job and I signed the contract that day. She also did my make up for my bachelorette party during this time. It was stunning. Angela came to The Westin, to my suite and did my five bridesmaids, my two juniors, my mom and me. She was on time, and kept US on time, more importantly. She made each one of us look absolutley stunning. She took time to make each of us look perfect, highlighting our features in different ways. She captured the elegant feel of our night time, october wedding. My pictures came out STUNNING. I have never felt or looked so beautiful in my life and Angela had a lot to do with that-she was always there and often reminded me of her favorite saying "Your wedding day is YOUR superbowl" . If you are looking for a makeup artist who you trust, who will work hard for you, at incredibley reasonable price, be professional and make you look and feel like a star, she is the one</cite>

                    <li><cite>Angela is amazing. She is a perfectionist and she is above and beyond a professional. She KNOWS the make-up that matches the bride and she does outstanding work. I received compliments all evening about my make-up and the photos are the evidence of that. Not only that, but she knows how to calm a bride in the bridal suite so she doesn't cause physical harm to annoying family members!!!!!!! I highly recommend Angela to any and everyone. She is AWESOME.</cite>

I wish I could get my makeup done like that more often!</cite>
